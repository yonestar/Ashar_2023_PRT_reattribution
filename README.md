# Semantic analyses of pain reattribution in pain reprocessing therapy

This study aims to understand how people with chronic back pain think about the underlying causes of their pain, to test whether pain reprocessing therapy (PRT) changes those attributions, and whether reattribution may be a mechanism by which PRT leads to pain relief.
